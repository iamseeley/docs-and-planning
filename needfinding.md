# Needfinding Report

## 1. Project Summary

Our project aims to develop an AI-powered web application that automatically generates detailed NPCs for D&D campaigns, with customizable parameters for names, backgrounds, traits, and dialogue options. The application will be built using a React frontend, MongoDB, Python, and FastAPI backend, and will employ GitHub Actions for automated testing and deployment. By leveraging AI technology and modern web development practices, our project seeks to provide D&D enthusiasts with a powerful tool for enhancing their gaming experiences and streamlining the process of creating engaging and immersive NPCs.

## 2. Selected Needfinding Method(s) and Reasoning

For this needfinding report, we conducted a semi-structured interview with an experienced Dungeons & Dragons (D&D) player to gather insights into their goals, needs, and practices. The participant, Alex, was selected due to their 3 years of experience playing D&D regularly and their familiarity with both the player and Dungeon Master (DM) roles.

## 3. Data Collection Raw Results

Interviewer: Thomas Seeley

1. Experience with D&D:
   - Alex has been playing D&D for about 3 years.
   - They try to play weekly but realistically play 2-3 times a month.
   - Alex is primarily a player but has DMed a handful of one-shots.

2. Campaigns and Settings:
   - One memorable experience was when their party accidentally awakened an ancient dragon while exploring ruins, kicking off an epic quest to prevent the dragon from destroying nearby settlements.

3. Challenges as a DM:
   - The biggest challenge Alex faces as a DM is balancing preparation with improvisation, especially when players do unexpected things.
   - They once had a player decide to befriend a minor villain planned as a recurring antagonist, forcing them to rethink future plot points.
   - For prep, Alex jots down key plot points, NPC details, and potential encounters in a notebook and uses online random generators for names and loot.

4. Use of Technology:
   - Alex uses D&D Beyond for character sheets and quick rule lookups and has used Roll20 for virtual tabletop when unable to meet in person.
   - These tools help streamline inventory management and dice rolling but can be clunky sometimes.
   - Alex wishes D&D Beyond had better integration with homebrew content and more robust encounter building tools.

5. Feature Wishlist:
   - An ideal AI assistant would be able to generate NPCs with unique personalities, create interesting plot hooks on the fly, and help with balancing encounters.
   - The most critical feature would be NPC generation with consistent personalities and motivations.
   - Alex ranks the features: 1) NPC generation, 2) quest creation, 3) world-building, 4) item descriptions.

6. Interaction with AI:
   - Alex wants a good amount of control over the AI's outputs, with the ability to set parameters or edit generated content.
   - Ideally, they'd like to be able to rate or thumbs up/down specific outputs to help the AI learn their preferences over time.

7. Potential Concerns:
   - Alex's main concern is relying too heavily on the AI and losing some of the personal creative touches that make each campaign unique.
   - Some players might worry about the game feeling too "formulaic" if an AI is generating a lot of the content.

8. Impact on Gameplay:
   - An AI assistant could potentially speed up prep time and help with on-the-spot creativity but risks making the game feel less personal or unique.
   - It could be helpful for generating random encounters or side quests but might struggle with maintaining long-term narrative consistency.
   - If the AI's output doesn't fit well, Alex would use it as inspiration rather than taking it verbatim, tweaking details to fit their campaign.

9. Final Thoughts:
   - Alex suggests it would be cool if the AI could learn from your campaign setting over time, becoming more attuned to your specific world and style.
   - They are interested in beta testing or providing feedback and can be reached at alexdndplayer@email.com for updates or further research.


Interviewer: Jacob Harris

1. Jamil Omer, played for about 2 years.
-2 times a week
-Only played as a player.

2. I played as a monk and I sacrificed my life to fend off an entire army to save my beloved wife in game.

3. Never played as one.

4.We use D&D Beyond an App. It helped me as a player by keeping track of my abilities, my attacks, and my inventory.
-It does a pretty solid job, it would be nice if i could create a custom character to resemble my imaginitation of my character.

5.It would be cool to have ai chats with the npcs in game, so it can be easier on the DM instead of him having to track and come up with multiple converstations.
-I think all of those would be really cool, rank in order from best to least would be: world building, quest creation, item description, and NPC generation.

6. It would be nice to have settings or maybe even take in data from the dm so the ai knows the type of "vibe" or theme to match to satisfy the dm. Then the dm can rate the generations so the ai can learn to change and satisfy the dm.

7. Some concerns would possible be the ai generations are too dull or obviously created by ai and show no signs of creativity. I think others would agree because dungeon and dragons feeds off of creativity and if you take that away then its a completely new game.

8. I feel like it would be good to use as a touch up or for subtle things, not to create a whole campaign or anything around thta level. For example, you could create an item and then you could use ai to help think of UPGRADES for that certain item.
- to handle a situiation where ai feels like it doesnt fit with the campaign of course it can kinda ruin the vibe but at the end the DM is in control so he could simly retract time and think of a bettter way to handle the situation.

9. Maybe art generation for certain peoples items, yes i would be interested in testing. 615-710-5168 hit my line.

1a.Lauson Tassie, 2 Years
1b.Twice a week.
1c.Player

2a.I played as a paladin and was constantly healing my monk.

3. N/A

4a.D&D Beyond It helps with abilities and levels and items. The limitations of the freedom of making custom items is kind of bad.

5. I would want the AI to make a character based on the backstory I give the AI, the most critical thing would be to make the abilities custom to my lore.

6. Quest making, world generation with a map, and NPC characters.

7. The ai's ability to remember the lore of the campaign given campaigns can take months to finish.

8. The ai can make it more immersive with its verbiage. Making the players visualization of what is happening. An example would be if you are in a dark dungeon the ai could paint that picture for that players amazingly especially when it comes to the story of the the campaign.

9. Creating items, characters, story, npcs, all the above. I would love to participate in future testing to provide better feedback.

Interviewer: Tyler Earps

1. Corey, Been playing since covid lockdown, started on Roll20. I played in campaigns and one-shots regularly for a couple years. Now it's more spotty. I have ran a lost mines of phandelver as a DM and also tried another larger campaign but got overwhelmed lol. Mainly play as a player though. Big fan of cleric and warlock.

2. Memorable experiences have come down to the DM I have mostly played with, who is great. Midway through our campaign, months in... My half-orc cleric sold his soul to a devil in some ring of hell before taking a mission stirring in with the campaign. I came back to the party and morphed into a tiefling warlock and the DM described it great as I transformed before my party. Was awesome. Setting wise though, I respect a lot of campaign settings. A lot of the campaigns are well written and the maps on roll20 help a lot with visualization. Same with the custom backgrounds.

3. I did really well DMing the larger campaign up until I realized that my 3 hours ish of prep reading wasn't enough since there were like 36+ side quests and tons of characters I didn't know how to approach. Being a DM takes a lot of work and I have a ton of respect for them. Preparing for sessions would include going over location information, campaing info, double checking character sheets/info/inventories, reviewing notes from the final session, etc. I rely on D&D Beyond and Roll20

4. Roll20, D&D beyond character sheets and books. The books help from a quick access digital standpoint. Roll20 is a great platform to play on. It also has a camera function so you can see and hear your party while playing if external chat software like discord isnt used.

5. As a relatively inexperienced or maybe intermediate player I am constantly googling or checking roll20 or dnd beyond for information. The perfect AI assistant MUST include functionality to be able to search items, info, skills/spells, etc quickly. Generating features like NPC and quests would be AMAZING for homebrew imo. For someone more ingrained in the DM role they would probably love it. For me item descriptions is the most important with the others equally weighted.
6. see above, also control would be very important

7. No concerns. Embrace our AI overlords. People I know wouldn't really care to my knowledge.

8. I personally thing AI could add some serious benefit to the campaign.  I think if something doesn't fit you would just need the option to filter it out ahead of time... some sort of oversight before you speak on it or put it in front of your players

9. I think anything that helps new players would make this great.  I think DnD is incredibly vast and a lot of the information, lore and rules are hard to grasp with a lot going on in some campaigns.  That is partially the DMs job to explain and immerse the players but at the same time it could work both beneficially for players and DMs.

Interviewer: William Laforge

### Section 1: Background and Ice Breakers

#### Experience with D&D:

**What is your name and how long have you been playing Dungeons & Dragons?**

Joshua, About 3 years now.

**How often do you play D&D?**

Every Sunday as Player and every other week as a DM

**Do you primarily play as a Dungeon Master or a player?**

Player

#### Campaigns and Settings:

**What are some memorable experiences you've had during a D&D campaign?**

On the first session of the start of a new campaign my party and I all started aboard a ship just offshore of a popular coastal city. The ship we were on was just a wooden transport ship full of cargo and other people. The sky was cloudy and the air was foggy. We were attacked by a Kraken of sorts that started to tear the ship to shreds as my party and I (One of which was a wild shaped druid in cat form) narrowly escaped the Kraken and swam to shore. Sadly we weren’t able to save everyone from the krakens tentacles.

There was also another time we went ghost hunting in some haunted mansion. To which I and another member of my party got separated and we saw some spooky spooky demon stuff. And in the end we said screw it and jumped out of the window on the third floor and decided to burn the whole house instead. Can’t have a haunted house if there is no house right…..

### Section 2: Goals and Needs

#### Challenges as a DM:

**What are some of the biggest challenges you face as a Dungeon Master?**

Players are unpredictable and you never know what they will do next. So improv is a very important skill to have

**How do you currently prepare for your sessions?**

Hours of planning the session and building on the worlds lore

#### Use of Technology:

**Do you use any tools or software to assist with your D&D sessions? If so, which ones?**

Yes, Inkarnate for battle maps and dndbeyond for campaign/character management

**How do these tools help you, and what are their limitations?**

Allow me to create battle maps to immerse players. Unsure about limitations.

### Section 3: Desired Features and Functionality

#### Feature Wishlist:

**If you could design the perfect AI assistant for D&D, what features would it have?**

If AI could build random NPC’s and cool locations in a town that would be great. EX: Every town needs an armory, town watch, government building, Multiple Taverns, and other places of interest. AI could create names and small backgrounds for these places as well as all the owners of said establishments. It could also generate characters to be inside Taverns and other places.

AI could also generate fun side quests as well. Every town should have a bulletin board with various quests attached with rewards. AI could generate these quests that players could go on if desired.

**How important are features like NPC generation, quest creation, item descriptions, and world-building to you?**

It would be very convenient and save me a lot of time! So like a solid 8/10

#### Interaction with AI: (Explain the Dungeon Master AI project concept)

**How much control would you like to have over the AI's outputs (e.g., ability to edit or customize generated content)?**

Depends on the type of campaign. For short campaigns I would prefer to streamline the story and come up with my own content/lore. For longer campaigns that could take years to complete AI would be nice to have more control to save me time.

### Section 4: Feedback and Concerns

#### Potential Concerns:

**What concerns do you have about using an AI assistant for D&D?**

That the lore the AI generates doesn’t make sense with the world I have built. Example: I am running a Greek campaign based on mythic odyssey of Theros and if AI designed a quest where we encountered races that don’t exist in my world but are generally in most DND campaigns.

#### Impact on Gameplay:

**How do you think an AI assistant would impact the storytelling and creativity aspects of your sessions?**

Depending on the AI it could be very interesting and creative!

**Are there any specific scenarios where you think an AI assistant would be particularly useful or detrimental?**

Random encounters during traveling. That way there is some background on the EX: Group of raiders that decided to try and steal your cart while your group is sleeping. In a matter of seconds AI could generate the names and backstories of all these raiders and if they are in a type of thieves’ guild and all that stuff.

### Section 5: Wrap-Up

#### Final Thoughts:

**Do you have any other comments or suggestions regarding a Dungeon Master AI project?**

PICTURES!!!!! Too many times, I have to find google images of monsters to use for the Combat maps. If your AI could generate dnd-like images of monsters and characters and items based on description that would be great

**Would you be interested in participating in future testing or providing further feedback?**

Heck yeah!
