# Needfinding Report

## 1. Project Summary

*[Quick summary of your project, iterated from Module 2 assignment.]*

## 2. Selected Needfinding Method(s) and Reasoning

For this needfinding report, we conducted a semi-structured interview with an experienced Dungeons & Dragons (D&D) player to gather insights into their goals, needs, and practices. The participant, Alex, was selected due to their 3 years of experience playing D&D regularly and their familiarity with both the player and Dungeon Master (DM) roles.

### Interview with Alex, an experienced D&D player
Date: 06/24/23
Interviewer: Thomas Seeley

1. Experience with D&D:
   - Alex has been playing D&D for about 3 years.
   - They try to play weekly but realistically play 2-3 times a month.
   - Alex is primarily a player but has DMed a handful of one-shots.

2. Campaigns and Settings:
   - One memorable experience was when their party accidentally awakened an ancient dragon while exploring ruins, kicking off an epic quest to prevent the dragon from destroying nearby settlements.

3. Challenges as a DM:
   - The biggest challenge Alex faces as a DM is balancing preparation with improvisation, especially when players do unexpected things.
   - They once had a player decide to befriend a minor villain planned as a recurring antagonist, forcing them to rethink future plot points.
   - For prep, Alex jots down key plot points, NPC details, and potential encounters in a notebook and uses online random generators for names and loot.

4. Use of Technology:
   - Alex uses D&D Beyond for character sheets and quick rule lookups and has used Roll20 for virtual tabletop when unable to meet in person.
   - These tools help streamline inventory management and dice rolling but can be clunky sometimes.
   - Alex wishes D&D Beyond had better integration with homebrew content and more robust encounter building tools.

5. Feature Wishlist:
   - An ideal AI assistant would be able to generate NPCs with unique personalities, create interesting plot hooks on the fly, and help with balancing encounters.
   - The most critical feature would be NPC generation with consistent personalities and motivations.
   - Alex ranks the features: 1) NPC generation, 2) quest creation, 3) world-building, 4) item descriptions.

6. Interaction with AI:
   - Alex wants a good amount of control over the AI's outputs, with the ability to set parameters or edit generated content.
   - Ideally, they'd like to be able to rate or thumbs up/down specific outputs to help the AI learn their preferences over time.

7. Potential Concerns:
   - Alex's main concern is relying too heavily on the AI and losing some of the personal creative touches that make each campaign unique.
   - Some players might worry about the game feeling too "formulaic" if an AI is generating a lot of the content.

8. Impact on Gameplay:
   - An AI assistant could potentially speed up prep time and help with on-the-spot creativity but risks making the game feel less personal or unique.
   - It could be helpful for generating random encounters or side quests but might struggle with maintaining long-term narrative consistency.
   - If the AI's output doesn't fit well, Alex would use it as inspiration rather than taking it verbatim, tweaking details to fit their campaign.

9. Final Thoughts:
   - Alex suggests it would be cool if the AI could learn from your campaign setting over time, becoming more attuned to your specific world and style.
