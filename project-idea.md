# Project Idea (Pitch)

```text
Our project idea is an application designed to enhance the experience of
Dungeon Masters (DMs) and players of Dungeons & Dragons (D&D). Taking from
Jeff’s idea this project would leverage Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)
technology, the application assists in generating rich, detailed, and
contextually accurate content for campaigns, including NPCs, quests, item
descriptions, and world-building elements. By integrating a base of D&D lore
and advanced AI models, this app aims to streamline game preparation and
inspire creativity, making every session more immersive and enjoyable.

Objectives:

• Enhance Efficiency: Reduce the time and effort required by DMs to prepare for
  sessions by providing high-quality, ready-to-use content.

• Boost Creativity: Offer fresh ideas and inspiration to DMs and players,
  fostering more engaging and dynamic storytelling. Possible Features
  include

  o NPC Generator:

    - Automatically generate detailed NPCs with names, backgrounds, traits, and
      dialogue options.

    - Customizable parameters to tailor NPCs to specific campaign needs.

Technology Stack:

o Backend: Python with FastAPI, Elasticsearch for retrieval, Mongo DB backend
  for flexible / evolving data models and dynamically generated NPC’s

o Frontend: SVELTE or React

o AI Models: Transformer-based models for text generation, fine-tuned on D&D
  datasets.  ( Need to research what data sets are out there )
